# Simple-Neural-Network
In this project we will carry out from data processing to designing and developing a simple neural network to model relationship between 6 explanatory variables and 1 dependent variable.Essentially we will be modelling a simplest single layer neural network to check performance of neural network on data set of admission with respect to several other constraints.
# Getting started
First we will download required dependencies to get started with this project
```
pip install numpy
pip install sklearn
pip install matplotlib
```
Now your setup is ready for running this project.
# Usage Example
Our main code in written in a well documented notebook that explains everything perform data acquistion to data preprocessing and eventually data modelling with various contraints.
However here are some usage examples,
```
will be added later
```
